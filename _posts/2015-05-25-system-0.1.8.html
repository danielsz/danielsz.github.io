<a href="https://github.com/danielsz/system">System</a> started its life as a component library, a high-level convenience library on top of Stuart Sierra's components, providing community-backed, ready-made components: http-kit, datomic, monger and the usual suspects. 
</p>

<p>
System 0.1.8 has just been released, but it is not the same anymore. It is different, changed—even I have trouble to recognize its old self. I suppose you could call this a metamorphosis. Indeed, this looks every bit like the workings of a spell. System has met <a href="http://boot-clj.com/">Boot</a>, and the attraction has proven irresistible. The two went off, and there is nothing I could do to stop it. 
</p>

<p>
With Boot, system acts like a smooth operator, enhancing your flow. It aims to take care of the nitty-gritty aspects of keeping an application up while it is being written. In the seventies, they called this Interactive programming. It is also known as REPL-based programming, Lisp-style programming or live coding. 
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the properties that boot-system brings to your workflow:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Manual and automatic mode, ie. either you manipulate the system in the REPL, or you configure it to react to editing changes.
</li>
<li>Restartable system. What warrants a system restart is user-configurable. File-based granularity.
</li>
<li>Changes that do not require a restart are available in the running system instantly (via namespace reloading).
</li>
<li>Full Lisp-style interactive programming via the REPL and hot-reloading in the browser.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: System continues to be a convenience library with ready-made components, fully compatible with Leiningen. As a matter of fact, the latest version ships with a new ElasticSearch component, courtesy of Jan Stępień.
