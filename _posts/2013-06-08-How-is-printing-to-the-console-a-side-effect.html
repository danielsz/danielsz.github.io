<p>
Functional programming favors functions that have no side effects. For
a beginner, this statement represents a double conundrum.
</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a side effect? 
</li>
<li>How does it matter?
</li>
</ul>


<p>
So let's try again, but in reverse. Functional programming favors
functions that, for a given input, will consistently return the same
output. In algebra, a function is a notation to describe a
relation. Not any type of relation, but the special case where every
element that goes in (input) results in a single element getting out
(output). Contrast this with equations, graphs, coordinates or ordered
pairs, where such a constraint doesn't apply.
</p>
<p>
Functional programming strives to work with so-called pure functions
because they allow clarity of thought. It is easy to reason about pure
functions, because once defined, they are like black boxes whoses
intricacies can be put aside, and you can then use them as building
blocks to compute operations of ascending complexity.
</p>
<p>
The same cannot be said about functions that have side effects. Those
can produce different outputs given the same input. We don't need to
use a functional language to do the demonstration. Let's take <i>print formatted</i>, or <code>printf</code>, a function in C, an imperative language, used
to print a string to standard output. In order to make our point, we
need to show that calling the function twice with the same parameter
can result in different outputs.
</p>
<p>
<code>printf</code> takes a string and returns the number of characters
printed, or -1 when the printing was unsuccesful.

<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #A020F0;">#include</span> <span style="color: #4E9A06;">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #2F8B58; font-weight: bold;">int</span> <span style="color: #00578E; font-weight: bold;">main</span>()
{
  <span style="color: #2F8B58; font-weight: bold;">int</span> <span style="color: #0084C8; font-weight: bold;">rc</span>;
  rc = printf(<span style="color: #4E9A06;">"test\n"</span>);             <span style="color: #204A87;">/* </span><span style="color: #204A87;">printing test string </span><span style="color: #204A87;">*/</span>
  fprintf(stderr, <span style="color: #4E9A06;">"rc: %d\n"</span>, rc);   <span style="color: #204A87;">/* </span><span style="color: #204A87;">return code of succesful printf call </span>
<span style="color: #204A87;">                                        5 in this case </span><span style="color: #204A87;">*/</span>
  fclose(stdout);                    <span style="color: #204A87;">/* </span><span style="color: #204A87;">closing standard output </span><span style="color: #204A87;">*/</span>
  rc = printf(<span style="color: #4E9A06;">"test\n"</span>);             <span style="color: #204A87;">/* </span><span style="color: #204A87;">printing test string (don't hold your breath) </span><span style="color: #204A87;">*/</span>
  fprintf(stderr, <span style="color: #4E9A06;">"rc: %d\n"</span>, rc);   <span style="color: #204A87;">/* </span><span style="color: #204A87;">return code of unsuccesful prinf call </span>
<span style="color: #204A87;">                                        returns -1  </span><span style="color: #204A87;">*/</span>
}

</pre>


<p>
So here is our proof: the input to <code>printf</code> was the string "test\n",
the output was 5 when STDOUT was available, -1 after it was
closed. <code>printf</code> is clearly not a pure function. It is dependent on
the state of the console, an abstract I/O device that may or may not
be ready.
</p>
<p>
Side effects, while coveted, ought to be contained, reducing thereby
the area where "bad things" can happen. When you write in the
functional style, you strive to separate pure functions from functions
with side effects, so as not to worry about state in the same place
where you write rules and logic. This will yield great benefit when
reasoning about your program.

<p>
A function that consistently produces the same output given a same
input has tremendous benefit, because now we can substitute it with
its return value without affecting the outer code. In professional
literature, this property is referred to as <b>referential transparency</b>. The ability to carry such substitutions allows for all
kinds of optimizations in our programs: memoization, proofs,
parallelization. And it's not hard to guess that referentially
transparent functions will be easier to test, too. Some functional
languages enforce referential transparency at the language
level. Haskell, for example, wraps all I/O operations in a monad. Lisp
languages don't (including Clojure). It is the programmer's
responsiblity to ascertain that property in the functions being
composed. On the other hand, when a function is used merely for its
side effects, special forms may be provided for convenience purposes,
like <code>mapc</code>, the companion to <code>mapcar</code> in Emacs Lisp.
