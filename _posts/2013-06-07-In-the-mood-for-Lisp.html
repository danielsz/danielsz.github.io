<p>
Just like in the Hong-Kong movie "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Mood_for_Love">In the mood for love"</a>, where love is hinted at in every scene but consummated in none, I have dreamt of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine">Lisp Machine</a> without ever having seeing one, <a href="http://frostpoetry.blogspot.co.il/2010/12/neither-out-far-nor-in-deep-by-robert.html">neither out far nor in deep</a>.
</p>
<p>
So when I put my hands on a 35$ credit-card sized computer, the curiously named Raspberry Pi, I felt the urge to pay tribute to the act of longing for elusive Lisp Machines, be it through pretense and travesty. 
</p>
<p>
<b>TL;DR:</b> Cookbook-style recipe to lispify your Raspberry Pi. 
</p>
<p>
The cunning scheme unfolds in three acts. Two of those have been documented better than I ever could, so references will suffice. I'll dwell a bit longer on the third step.

<p>
Why? Because the packaged Emacs on Debian "Wheezy" is behind by a major version, and because building Emacs from source is straightforward.

<i>Note:</i> Unlike the author, I did not have to symlink gcc.

<p>
Building Emacs on Raspbian is actually no different that what is called for on generic Debian, so <a href="http://www.plusastra.com/2012/11/installing-emacs-24-on-debian-wheezy.html">instructions</a> should be interchangeable.

<h3 id="sec-2">Install Clozure Common Lisp</h3>

<p>
On Raspbian, I could not find a packaged Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL), and while GNU CLISP was available with apt-get and running fine, I could not get it to play nicely with Stumpwm's dependencies. Fear not, because Clozure CL is a Lisp of noble descent that can be optimized for the ARM processor. Follow the excellent instructions courtesy of renowned Lisp hacker Rainer Joswig.

<p>
Raspbian comes by default with LXDE, but we're after a lean, keyboard-only, Lisp-based, prefix driven Ã  la Emacs, tiling window manager. Getting this right was actually the trickiest part, because none of the official instructions led to a working setup. I will spare you the failing strategies and the burnt hours, jumping straight to the winning combo, enabled by the heroic feats of Zach Beane and his Quicklisp project, a dependency management system Common Lispers had been waiting for since the dawn of the paren.

<p>
Download quicklisp.
</p>



<pre class="src src-shell">$ curl -O http://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
</pre>


<p>
Install quicklisp.
</p>



<pre class="src src-lisp">(load <span style="color: #4E9A06;">"/path/to/quicklisp.lisp"</span>)
(quicklisp-quickstart:install)
</pre>


<p>
Proceed to installing Stumpwm.
</p>



<pre class="src src-lisp">(ql:quickload <span style="color: #4E9A06;">"stumpwm"</span>)
</pre>


<p>
In your CCL init file, make sure you defined a function to load quicklisp on demand, as Rainer Joswig recommends.
</p>



<pre class="src src-lisp">(<span style="color: #A52A2A; font-weight: bold;">defun</span> <span style="color: #00578E; font-weight: bold;">load-quicklisp</span> ()
  (<span style="color: #A52A2A; font-weight: bold;">let</span> ((quicklisp-init (merge-pathnames <span style="color: #4E9A06;">"quicklisp/setup.lisp"</span>
                                         (user-homedir-pathname))))
    (<span style="color: #A52A2A; font-weight: bold;">when</span> (probe-file quicklisp-init)
      (load quicklisp-init))))
</pre>


<p>
Now we can load Stumpwm in X. Put the following in your .Xinitrc the following:
</p>



<pre class="src src-shell">exec ccl -e <span style="color: #4E9A06;">"(load-quicklisp)"</span> -e <span style="color: #4E9A06;">"(ql:quickload \"stumpwm\")"</span> -e <span style="color: #4E9A06;">"(stumpwm:stumpwm)"</span>
</pre>


<p>
That's it.

The Raspberry Pi has spawned renewed interest in non-mainstream OSes like RISC OS and Plan 9, but one can experiment delightfully as well while staying on the stock Raspbian. With a little bit of effort and a lot of imagination, you can even pretend you're driving a Lisp machine.
