<p>A burgeoning but vibrant Ruby developer community meets up once a month in the Tel-Aviv area, thanks to the efforts of Roy Osherove and some leading Ruby developers. I had the honor to conduct a talk this time (December), and my subject was metaprogramming from scratch. Since this is normally considered an advanced subject, I took the approach to explain core concepts through runnable code snippets that the participants could feed instantly&nbsp;into an interactive shell and see the results. The main exercise was a custom implementation of the Ruby built-in method "attr_accessor" using metaprogramming techniques.</p>
<p>Here are the <a href="http://danielsz.github.com/underground_talk_dec_19" title="Slides">slides</a>, and here are&nbsp;the <a href="https://github.com/danielsz/Metaprogramming" title="exercise files">exercise</a> files. I used <a href="https://github.com/schacon/showoff">showoff</a>, an open source project, as the presentation software, and I really liked the experience. Recommended.&nbsp;</p>
