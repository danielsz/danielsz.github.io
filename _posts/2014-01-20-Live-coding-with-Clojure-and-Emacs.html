Live coding is a methodology and a mindset that lends itself to all kinds of scenarios. When composing music, designing an algorithm or sketching with CSS, instant feedback informs the creator of his ideas while he's nurturing them. The workflow influences the thought process as it's happening. It’s a bottom-up approach, well-known among Lispers, but also by artists of all kinds. Live coding is to programmers what jazz is to musicians, a culture of improvisation, a set of techniques that fluidify the pursuit of a higher goal.

This post is meant to demonstrate what becomes possible when you merge powerful interactive programming environments such as Clojure and Emacs. Emacs is well known to be a glorified interactive environment. Clojure, as a Lisp language, provided a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%25E2%2580%2593eval%25E2%2580%2593print_loop">REPL</a> from day one. The tooling around it, on the other hand, took some time to coalesce. In the early days, every IDE came with its own REPL foundation (<a href="https://github.com/EricThorsen/enclojure-repl">enclojure-repl</a>, <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure">swank-clojure</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/">counterclockwise</a>). Then the nREPL came along—a community effort to standardize protocols and APIs around the REPL. Cider is an Emacs Lisp client that leverages the nREPL to great effect, establishing interoperability between the Clojure and Emacs ecosystems, and offering many tooling opportunities in the process.

<p>
Let’s consider <a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/">sketching with CSS</a>, a new and welcome trend in web design that eschews photoshop comps, mockups or prototypes. Instead, the design process takes place in the target medium—the browser—from the get-go. This strategy is sound and cost-effective because it eliminates the need for an intermediary, redundant stage of converting media to and fro authoring tools. 
</p>

<p>
A live coding setup for web applications is not always trivial: code typically runs on the server-side <b>and</b> on the client-side, two environments with which you might want to interact. Known techniques include a plugin called <b><a href="https://github.com/weavejester/lein-ring">lein-ring</a></b>, providing hot reloading when Ring handlers change. Or Stuart Sierra's <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded">reloaded</a> workflow, which allows you to refresh your application code at the tip of a keyboard binding. Also, specialized REPLs such as <a href="https://github.com/cemerick/austin">Austin</a> are available for Clojurescript, enabling real-time in-browser interaction. 
</p>

<p>
But sketching with CSS is a simple use case that calls for a simple workflow. All we need is sending a HTML string to a running browser. Emacs Lisper Brian Taylor wrote an extension mode called <a href="http://www.50ply.com/blog/2012/08/13/introducing-impatient-mode/"><b>impatient-mode</b></a>, initially used on buffers with HTML source. Since we’re dealing with Clojure source code and not HTML, I've submitted a <a href="https://github.com/netguy204/imp.el/pull/13">patch</a> that allows to define a user filter on the current buffer, so that transformation to HTML can occur prior to the browser dispatch. The patch has been merged and the functionality is now available in <a href="https://github.com/netguy204/imp.el">master</a>.

Here is a demo adapted from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dt6GoK1yGcFM">flexbox tutorial</a> by Sean Firoritto:

A quick glance at the github <a href="https://github.com/danielsz/sketching-with-css-in-clojure">repo</a> will reveal a bare minimum setup: only one source file and two dependencies in <b>project.clj</b>. So how is this possible? Hiccup emits HTML strings. Garden emits CSS directives. It's all strings, after all. You still need a Clojure REPL in the background to evaluate your hiccup and garden functions, but that's about it. 
</p>

<p>
If you're going to try this at home, and you should, here are the steps to repeat: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Clone the repo.
</li>
</ol>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">$ git clone git@github.com:danielsz/sketching-with-css-in-clojure.git
$ cd sketching-with-css-in-clojure
$ emacs src/fioritto/sketch.clj
</pre>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="2">In Emacs, start a Clojure REPL, for example <code>M-x cider-jack-in</code> and load the file with <code>C-c C-l</code> or <code>cider-load-file</code>.
</li>
<li>Start Emacs's embedded web server. <code>M-x httpd-start</code>
</li>
<li>With the buffer visiting sketch.clj, start <b>impatient-mode</b>, <code>M-x impatient mode</code>.
</li>
<li>Try now: <code>M-x imp-visit-buffer</code>. You will see the buffer in your browser. That's because the default filter for non-html source files is set to <code>htmlize</code>. We'll want to set our own filter for Clojure buffers. 
</li>
<li>The user filter, a regular Emacs lisp function, can be found in the root folder of the project (sketching.el). Open it and evaluate it (<code>C-M-x</code> or <code>C-x C-e</code>) so that Emacs knows about it. Now <code>M-x imp-set-user-filter</code> and type <b>imp-clj-html</b>. 
</li>
</ol>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #a020f0;">require</span> '<span style="color: #008b8b;">s</span>)

(<span style="color: #a020f0;">defun</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">imp-clj-html</span> (buffer)
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">with-current-buffer</span> (get-buffer buffer)
    (cider-eval-defun-at-point))
  (<span style="color: #a020f0;">let*</span> ((content (<span style="color: #a020f0;">with-temp-buffer</span> 
                    (cider-interactive-eval-print <span style="color: #8b2252;">"(fioritto.sketch/page)"</span>)
                    (sleep-for 0.1)
                    (buffer-string)))
         (sanitized-content (s-replace-all '((<span style="color: #8b2252;">"\\n"</span> . <span style="color: #8b2252;">""</span>) (<span style="color: #8b2252;">"\\\""</span> . <span style="color: #8b2252;">"'"</span>)) content)))
    (princ sanitized-content (current-buffer))
    )
  (delete-region (point-min) (+ (point-min) 1))
  (delete-region (- (point-max) 1) (point-max)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The secret sauce is <b>cider-interactive-eval-print</b>, which evaluates a Clojure expression and prints its output in an Emacs buffer. In our case, it calls <b>fioritto.sketch/page</b> on the REPL, a HTML emitting function, wich <b>impatient-mode</b> will subsequently send to the browser.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li value="7">Try again: <code>M-x imp-visit-buffer</code>. Now make changes in your Clojure buffer and witness instant rendering in the browser.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Happy live coding!
