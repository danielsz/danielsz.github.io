<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Quick-Start">Clojurescript quick start</a> guide has been converted into a Homebrew formula, but since that move has proven to be <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/pull/21744">contentious</a>, and since I have no idea how long it will take before it gets approved, if ever, I made the formula available directly from a github repository.

<p>
All you need to do is:
</p>



<pre class="src src-bash">brew tap danielsz/clojurescript
brew install clojurescript
</pre>


<p>
This will put the `clojurescript` compiler as an independent executable on your path, but please note that for most intents and purposes, you will want to work with `leiningen` and add `clojurescript` as a project dependency.
